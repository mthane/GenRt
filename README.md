# GenRt
Generative Art Using R and ggplot2 and Shiny

This is a project for the course "Creative Coding and Aesthetic Programming" at the University of Magdeburg by Jun.-Prof. Dr. Dan Verst√§ndig and M.A. Rita Eperjesi.
In this project I tried to use ggplot2 and shiny to build a web application that uses data visualization to create generative art and tries to learn the users preferences.
